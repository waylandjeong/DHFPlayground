# DHF Playground

This is a playground for experimenting with document collaboration on github.

TODO:
* Investigate a method for integrating a PR workflow with an external function that renders MD to doc format (i.e. running Pandoc in a Lambda that is kicked-off via webhook)
* Investigate user interface wrappers around the code review process to simplify the user  experience
* Investigate Reviewable - setup a tmp repo (DHFPlayground) and use Reviewable to review and approve a PR
* Test webhook integration with ngrok and local Flask app
* Try different workflows focused on simplicity
